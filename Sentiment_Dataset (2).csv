1,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive
2,"Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers.

4,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
5,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
6,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
7,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
8,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
9,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
10,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
11,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
12,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
13,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
14,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive
15,"An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.",positive
16,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
17,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
18,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
19,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.",positive
20,I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.,negative
21,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
22,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
23,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
24,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
25,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

34,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
35,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
36,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
37,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
38,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
39,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

41,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive

43,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

48,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
49,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
50,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
51,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
75,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
76,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

79,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
80,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
81,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

100,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
101,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive
102,"Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers.

Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
104,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
105,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
106,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
107,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
108,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
109,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
110,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
111,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
112,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
113,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
114,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive
115,"An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.",positive
116,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive

Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
130,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
131,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
132,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
133,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
134,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
135,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
136,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
137,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
138,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
139,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

141,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive

143,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
147,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
148,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
149,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
150,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept.

155,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
156,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
159,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
160,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
161,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
162,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
163,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
164,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

166,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
167,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
168,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

173,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
174,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
175,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
176,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate.

Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
187,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

191,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive

193,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

199,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
200,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
201,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

204,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
205,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
206,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

225,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
226,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive
227,"Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

228,"If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
229,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
230,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
231,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
232,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
233,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
234,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
235,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
236,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
237,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
238,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
239,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive
240,"An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.",positive
241,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
251,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

254,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
255,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
256,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
257,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
258,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
259,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
260,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
261,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
262,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
263,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
264,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

266,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
267,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
268,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
272,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
273,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
274,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
275,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

280,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
281,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
282,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

283,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
284,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
285,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
286,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
287,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
288,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
289,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

291,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
292,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
293,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

296,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
297,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
298,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
299,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
300,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
301,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

308,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
312,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
314,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

316,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
317,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
318,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
319,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

321,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
322,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
323,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
324,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
325,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
326,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
329,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
330,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
331,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

350,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
351,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

354,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
355,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
356,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
357,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
358,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
359,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
360,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
361,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
362,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
363,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
364,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
376,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

379,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
380,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
381,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
382,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
383,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
384,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
385,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
386,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
387,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
388,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
389,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

391,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
392,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
393,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
397,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
398,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
399,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
400,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

405,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
406,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
407,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
408,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
409,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
410,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
411,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
412,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
413,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
414,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

416,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
417,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
418,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

421,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
422,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
423,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
424,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
425,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
426,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

433,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

436,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
437,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
439,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

441,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
442,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
443,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
444,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

446,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
447,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
448,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
449,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
450,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
451,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
454,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
455,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
456,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

475,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
476,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

479,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
480,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
481,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
482,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
483,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
484,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
485,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
486,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
487,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
488,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
489,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
501,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

504,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
505,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
506,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
507,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
508,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
509,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
510,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
511,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
512,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
513,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
514,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

516,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
517,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
518,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
522,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
523,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
524,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
525,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

530,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
531,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
532,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
533,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
534,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
535,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
536,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
537,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
538,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
539,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

541,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
542,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
543,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

546,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
547,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
548,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
549,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
550,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
551,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

558,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
562,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

566,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
567,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
568,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
569,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

571,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

573,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
574,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
575,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
576,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
579,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
580,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
581,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

600,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
601,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

604,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
605,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
606,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
607,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
608,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
609,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
610,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
611,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
612,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
613,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
614,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
626,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

629,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
630,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
631,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
632,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
633,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
634,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
635,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
636,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
637,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
638,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
639,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

641,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
642,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
643,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
647,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
648,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
649,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
650,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

655,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
656,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
657,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

658,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
659,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
660,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
661,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
662,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
663,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
664,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

666,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
667,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
668,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

671,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
672,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
673,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
674,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
675,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
676,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

683,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

686,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
687,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
689,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

691,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
692,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
693,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
694,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

696,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
697,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
698,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
699,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
700,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
701,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
704,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
705,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
706,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

725,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
726,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

729,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
730,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
731,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
732,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
733,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
734,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
735,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
736,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
737,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
738,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
739,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
751,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

754,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
755,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
756,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
757,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
758,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
759,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
760,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
761,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
762,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
763,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
764,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

766,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
767,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
768,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

773,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
774,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
775,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in.

When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept.

780,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
781,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

783,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
784,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
785,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
786,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
787,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
788,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
789,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

791,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
792,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
793,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

798,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
799,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
800,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
801,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

808,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
812,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
814,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

816,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
817,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
818,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
819,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

823,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
824,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
825,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
826,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

829,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
830,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
831,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

850,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
851,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

854,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
855,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
856,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
857,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
858,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
859,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
860,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view.

861,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
862,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
863,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
864,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
876,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

879,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
880,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
881,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
882,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

883,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
884,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
885,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
886,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
887,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
888,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
889,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

891,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive

893,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible.

Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive

898,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
899,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
900,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

905,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
906,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
907,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
908,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
909,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
910,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
911,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
912,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
913,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
914,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

916,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
917,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
918,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
919,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

921,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
922,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
923,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
924,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
925,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
926,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

933,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive

936,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
937,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
939,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

941,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",positive
942,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,neutral
943,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.",positive
944,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

946,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",positive
947,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.",positive
948,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.",positive
949,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children.",positive
950,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
951,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive

As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",positive
954,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
955,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
956,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive

975,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)
My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
976,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",positive
977,"Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers.

979,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",positive
980,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a clich?-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",positive
981,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",positive
982,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been.

Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,positive
983,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",positive
984,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",positive
985,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,positive
986,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",positive
987,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",positive
988,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",positive
989,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",positive

The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so.",positive
