            "Review 1: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 2: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 3: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 4: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))\n",
            "Review 5: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 6: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 7: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 8: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 9: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 10: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 11: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 12: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 13: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 14: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 15: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 16: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 17: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 18: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 19: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 20: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 21: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 22: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 23: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 25: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 26: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 27: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 30: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 31: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 32: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 33: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 34: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 35: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 36: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 37: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 38: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 39: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 40: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 41: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 43: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 44: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 45: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 46: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 47: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 48: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 55: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 57: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 58: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 59: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 60: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 61: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 62: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 63: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 64: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 65: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 66: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 68: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 69: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 70: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 71: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 72: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 73: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 74: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 75: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 76: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 83: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 84: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 85: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 86: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 87: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 88: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 90: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 91: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 93: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 94: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 95: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 96: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 97: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 98: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 100: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 101: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 102: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 105: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 107: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 112: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 113: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 115: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 118: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 119: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 120: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 121: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 122: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 123: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 124: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 125: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 126: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 127: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 128: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity.

It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker.

            "Review 130: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 131: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 132: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 133: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 134: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 135: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",

This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 144: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 145: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 146: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 147: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 148: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 149: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 150: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 151: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 152: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 153: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 154: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 155: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 156: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 157: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 158: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 159: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 160: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 161: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 162: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 163: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 164: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 165: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 166: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "Review 173: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 175: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 176: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 177: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",

            "Review 180: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 181: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 182: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 183: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 184: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 185: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 186: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 187: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 188: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 189: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 190: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 191: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 193: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 194: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 195: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 196: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 197: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 205: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 206: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 207: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 208: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 209: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 210: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 211: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 212: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 213: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 214: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 215: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 216: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 218: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 219: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 220: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 221: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 222: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 223: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 224: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 225: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 226: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 232: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 233: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 234: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 235: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 236: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 237: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 238: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 240: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 241: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

            "Review 243: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 244: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 245: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 246: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 247: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 248: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 250: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 251: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 259: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 260: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 261: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 262: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 268: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 269: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 270: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 271: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 272: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 273: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 275: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 276: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 277: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit.

            "Review 280: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 282: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story.

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 293: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 294: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "Review 297: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 298: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 300: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 301: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 302: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 305: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 307: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 308: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 309: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 310: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 311: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 312: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 313: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 323: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 325: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 326: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 327: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 328: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 329: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 330: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 331: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 332: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 333: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 334: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 335: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 336: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 337: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 338: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 339: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 340: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 341: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention.

            "Review 343: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 344: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 345: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 346: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 355: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 356: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 357: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 358: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 359: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 360: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 361: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 362: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 363: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 364: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 365: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 366: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 368: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 369: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 370: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 371: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 372: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 373: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 375: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 376: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing.

They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on.

And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 381: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 382: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 383: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 384: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 385: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 386: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 387: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 388: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 389: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 390: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 391: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 392: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 393: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 394: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 395: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 396: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 397: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 398: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 399: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 400: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 401: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 402: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit.

            "Review 408: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 409: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 410: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 411: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 412: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 413: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 415: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 416: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 418: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 419: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 420: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 421: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 422: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 423: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 424: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 425: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 426: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 427: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 430: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 432: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 438: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 440: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 441: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

            "Review 443: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 444: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 445: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 446: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 447: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 448: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 449: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 450: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 451: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 452: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 453: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker.

            "Review 455: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 456: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 457: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 458: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 459: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 460: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 461: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 462: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 472: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 473: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 475: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 476: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 477: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 478: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker.

            "Review 480: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 481: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 482: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 483: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 484: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 485: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 486: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 487: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 488: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 490: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 491: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 494: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 495: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete.

That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 501: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 502: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 503: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 504: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 505: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 506: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 507: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 508: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 509: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 510: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 511: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 512: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 513: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 514: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 515: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 516: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 518: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 519: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 520: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 521: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 522: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 523: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 530: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 532: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 533: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 534: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 535: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 536: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 537: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 538: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 540: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 541: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 543: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 544: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 545: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 546: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 547: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 548: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 549: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 550: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 551: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 558: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 559: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 560: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 561: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 562: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 563: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 565: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 566: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 568: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 569: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 570: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 571: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 572: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 573: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 575: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 576: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 577: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit.

            "Review 580: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 582: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 587: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 588: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 590: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 593: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 594: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 595: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 596: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 597: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 598: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 599: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 600: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 601: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 602: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",

            "Review 605: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 607: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 608: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 609: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 610: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",

This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 619: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 620: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 621: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 622: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 623: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 624: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 625: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 626: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 627: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 628: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 629: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 630: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 631: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 632: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 633: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 634: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 635: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 636: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 637: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 638: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 640: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 641: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "Review 648: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 650: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 651: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 652: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",

            "Review 655: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 656: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 657: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 658: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 659: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 660: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 661: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 662: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 663: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 665: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 666: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

            "Review 668: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 669: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 670: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 671: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 672: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 680: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 681: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 682: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 683: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 684: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 685: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 686: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 687: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 688: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 690: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 691: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention.

            "Review 693: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 694: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 695: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 696: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 697: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 698: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 700: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 701: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 707: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 708: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 709: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 710: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 711: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 712: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 713: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 715: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 716: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

            "Review 718: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 719: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 720: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 721: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 722: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 723: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 725: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 726: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 734: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 735: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 736: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 737: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 740: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 743: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 744: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 745: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 746: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 747: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 748: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 750: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 751: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 752: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit.

            "Review 755: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 757: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission.

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 769: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "Review 772: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 773: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 775: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 776: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 777: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 780: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 782: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 783: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 784: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 785: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 786: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 787: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 798: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 800: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 801: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 802: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 803: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 804: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 805: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 806: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 807: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 808: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 809: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 810: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 811: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 812: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 813: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 814: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 815: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 816: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention.

            "Review 818: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 819: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 820: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 821: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube.

They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 830: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 831: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 832: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 833: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 834: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 835: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 836: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 837: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 838: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 839: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 840: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 841: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 843: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 844: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 845: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 846: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 847: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 848: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 850: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 851: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible.

They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on.

And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 856: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 857: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 858: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 859: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 860: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 861: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 862: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 863: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 864: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 865: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 866: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 867: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 868: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 869: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 870: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 871: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 872: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 873: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 874: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 875: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 876: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 877: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit.

            "Review 883: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 884: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 885: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 886: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 887: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 888: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 890: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 891: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",

            "Review 893: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 894: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 895: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 896: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 897: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 898: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 900: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 901: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 902: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal.

            "Review 905: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

            "Review 907: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 913: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 915: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 918: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 919: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 920: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 921: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 922: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 923: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 924: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 925: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 926: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 927: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",

            "Review 930: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 931: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 932: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 933: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 934: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 935: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 936: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 937: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 947: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 948: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",

            "Review 950: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 951: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 952: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 953: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker.

            "Review 954: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 955: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 956: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 957: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 958: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 959: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 960: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 961: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 962: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 963: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",

            "Review 965: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 966: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 969: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",

That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 976: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 977: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 978: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 979: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))\n",
            "Review 980: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 981: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 982: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 983: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 984: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 985: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 986: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 987: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 988: Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!\n",
            "Review 989: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 990: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 991: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 992: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 993: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 994: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 995: You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.\n",
            "Review 996: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 997: From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome. A definite recommend.\n",
            "Review 998: Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5.\n",
            "Review 999: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 1000: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n"

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

Nothing can compare to this.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S.

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",
            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times. While not as nerve-jangling as their finest effort, it still manages to be an edge-of-the-seat ride on few occasions and keeps the audience invested despite the already known outcome.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",
            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "From the directors of Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo comes yet another nail-bitingly intense true life account that transfixed the world back in 2018. The Rescue chronicles the daring mission undertaken to save 13 lives trapped deep inside a flooded cave in Northern Thailand and highlights what the best of humanity can achieve when working towards a cause.Directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin, the film properly informs the viewers what the stakes are, the risks involved & the miracle it would take to pull off the dangerous operation and relies on interviews of people involved, media footage & re-enactments to show the rescue attempt as it was carried out. It's tense, suspenseful & involving despite knowing the end result.The documentary also sheds light on the high-risk world of cave diving, why some folks are into it and how their expertise made the mission a success. The events unfold with gripping intensity, evoking a sense of dread every now n then but the re-enacted scenes don't have the emotional weight that the interviews did. Also, it feels a bit incomplete as it is missing inputs from few vital sources.Overall, The Rescue is finely crafted, well-researched & expertly told and makes for a thrilling & captivating documentary about one of the most perilous & miraculous rescues in modern times.

            "Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is \"real\" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5., fresh world conquer oscar win doco free solo direct duo real life coupl jimmi chin elizabeth chai vasarhelyi return documentari space thrill explor captiv true life tale thailand cave rescu young boy soccer coach whole world watch come year ron howard australian shot featur film event joel edgerton colin farrel hit big screen rescu grip quintessenti look unbeliev true life event yet let mixtur recreat scene film well differ real footag actual time place faith reshot duo real life peopl rescu hard distinguish make unsur feel time seeingfocus mainli lifesav dive duo brit john volanthen rick stanton receiv help dare rescu plan australian doctordiv richard harri chin vasarhelyi find larger life figur walk u event lead eventu safe return lost boy coach central duo make likabl fascin narrat event take place whole world watch onbring home danger complic rescu mission soul rescu great job allow boot muddi ground tell stori relay thought feel experi back u give u close first hand experi would ever care occurr unforgiv unrel cave systemth problem experi aforement troubl discern genuin captur footag hollywood version event chin vasarhelyi shot stage usual reserv big budget event film there noth wrong documentari recreat certain event add context visual guid wouldv great move film make appar cant help feel slightli manipul film never appear show true handfin say fascin subject matter make thrill slightli manipul documentari rescu profici made put togeth lay gauntlet ron howard tri beat upcom featur film foil blanket\n",

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n"

However, it ultimately depends on individual proficiency in Python programming, web scraping, and NLP concepts.
