            "Review 1: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 2: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))\n",
            "Review 3: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 4: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 5: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 6: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 7: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 8: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 9: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 10: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 11: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 12: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 13: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 14: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 15: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 16: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 17: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 18: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 19: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 20: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 21: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 22: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 23: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 24: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 25: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 26: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue.

I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 30: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 31: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 32: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 33: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 34: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 35: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 36: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 37: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 38: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 39: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 40: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 41: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 42: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 43: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 44: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 45: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 46: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 47: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 48: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 49: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 50: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 51: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily.

The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 56: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 62: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 63: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 64: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 65: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 66: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 67: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 68: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 70: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 71: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 73: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 74: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 75: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 76: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 77: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 78: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 79: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 80: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention.

Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 88: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "Review 99: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 100: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 101: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 102: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 103: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 104: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 105: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 106: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 108: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 109: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",

            "Review 111: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",

But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die.

            "Review 126: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 128: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 129: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 130: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 131: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 132: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 133: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 134: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 135: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 136: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 137: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 138: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 139: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 140: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 141: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 142: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 143: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 145: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",

KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube.

            "Review 155: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

            "Review 156: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 157: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 158: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 159: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 160: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 161: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 162: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 163: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 164: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 165: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 166: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 167: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 168: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 169: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 170: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 171: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 172: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 173: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 174: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 175: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 176: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 193: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 196: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 199: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",

They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 201: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 202: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 203: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 204: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 205: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 206: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "Review 226: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 228: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 229: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 230: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 231: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 233: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 234: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 235: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 236: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 237: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 238: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",

Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 255: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 256: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 257: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 258: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 259: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 260: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 261: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 262: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 263: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 264: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 265: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 266: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 267: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 268: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 270: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 271: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 272: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 273: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 274: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 275: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",

Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring.

What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 286: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 287: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 288: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 289: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 290: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 291: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 292: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 293: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 295: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 296: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 297: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 298: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 299: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 300: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 301: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 304: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "Review 324: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 325: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 326: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 329: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 330: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 331: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 333: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die.

            "Review 351: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 352: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))\n",
            "Review 353: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 354: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 355: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 356: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 357: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 358: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 359: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 360: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 361: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 362: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 363: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 364: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 365: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 366: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 367: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 368: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 370: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",

            "Review 380: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

            "Review 381: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 382: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 383: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 384: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 385: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 386: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 387: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 388: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 389: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",

            "Review 391: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",

            "Review 393: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 395: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 396: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 397: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 398: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 399: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 400: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 401: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story.

There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 418: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 421: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 424: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",

They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 426: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 429: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 430: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

            "Review 451: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 452: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 453: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 454: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 455: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 456: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 458: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 459: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 460: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 461: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 462: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 463: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",

            "Review 476: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 480: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 481: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 482: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 483: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 484: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 485: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 486: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 487: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 488: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 489: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 490: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 491: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 492: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 493: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 494: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 495: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 496: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 497: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 498: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 499: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",

            "Review 505: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however.

Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 509: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 510: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 511: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 512: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 513: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 514: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 515: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 516: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",

            "Review 518: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 520: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 521: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 522: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 523: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 524: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 525: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 526: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in.

I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 546: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 549: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 550: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 551: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 553: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 554: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 555: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 556: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

            "Review 571: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die.

            "Review 576: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 577: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 578: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 579: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 580: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 581: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 582: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 583: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 584: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 585: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 586: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 587: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 588: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 589: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",

            "Review 591: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",

            "Review 593: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

            "Review 606: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 607: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 608: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 609: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 610: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 611: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 612: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 613: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 614: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 615: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 616: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 617: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 618: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 619: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 620: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 621: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 622: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 623: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 624: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 625: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 626: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story.

            "Review 631: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available).

            "Review 638: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 639: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 640: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 641: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 642: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 643: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 645: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 646: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 648: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 649: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 650: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 651: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 652: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes.

            "Review 653: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 654: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 655: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",

They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 676: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 678: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 679: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 680: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 681: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 683: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 684: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 685: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage.

What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 686: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 687: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",

            "Review 701: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 704: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are.

I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 705: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 706: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 707: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 708: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 709: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 710: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 711: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 712: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 713: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 714: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 715: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 716: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 717: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 718: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 719: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 720: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 721: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 722: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 723: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 724: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",

When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept.

            "Review 730: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 734: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 735: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 736: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 737: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 738: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 739: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",

            "Review 741: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 742: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 743: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 745: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 746: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 747: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 748: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 749: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 750: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 751: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 771: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 774: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",

They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 776: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 779: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 780: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 781: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die.

            "Review 801: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",
            "Review 802: Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.

            "Review 803: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 804: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 805: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 806: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 807: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 808: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 809: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 810: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 811: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 812: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 813: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 814: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",

            "Review 816: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",

We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 830: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 831: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 832: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 833: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 834: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 835: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 836: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 837: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 838: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 839: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 840: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 841: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 842: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 843: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 845: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 846: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 847: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 848: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 849: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 850: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 851: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false.

Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 856: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 863: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 864: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 865: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 866: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 867: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 868: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 870: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 871: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",

            "Review 874: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 875: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 876: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 879: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 880: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however.

            "Review 899: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 900: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 901: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 903: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 904: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 905: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 906: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 908: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 909: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",

But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die.

            "Review 926: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

            "Review 928: If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.\n",
            "Review 929: I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.\n",
            "Review 930: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.\n",
            "Review 931: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 932: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 933: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 934: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 935: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 936: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 937: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 938: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 939: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",

            "Review 941: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",

            "Review 943: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "Review 955: Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand.

            "Review 956: Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 957: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 958: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 959: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 960: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 961: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 962: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 963: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 964: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 965: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 966: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 967: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 968: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",

            "Review 970: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 971: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 972: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 973: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 974: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 975: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n",
            "Review 976: I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.\n",

So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.\n",
            "Review 982: One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.\n",
            "Review 983: The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.\n",
            "Review 984: I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.\n",
            "Review 985: What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!\n",
            "Review 986: Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.\n",
            "Review 987: \"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.\n",
            "Review 988: Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.\n",
            "Review 989: The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.\n",
            "Review 990: An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.\n",
            "Review 991: Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes.\n",
            "Review 992: A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.\n",
            "Review 993: What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.\n",
            "Review 994: I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.\n",
            "Review 995: This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.\n",
            "Review 996: This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.\n",
            "Review 997: Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful.\n",
            "Review 998: Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great.\n",
            "Review 999: I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear.\n",
            "Review 1000: I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.\n"

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed., make documentari compel besid fact true storytel intrigu subject matter lot whether one worth watch nation geograph rescu taken back see full pictur member thai youth soccer team dramat rescu flood cavether lot thing like rescu one get see thing unfold real time cours week took studi situat devis plan best chanc success weather element liter describ true miracl team expert cave diver led effort give firsthand account everi major decis twist turn involv race clock adrenalin come retel eventsth thrill factor rival anyth hollywood churn even though suspens given everyon gener know stori end rescu documentari appeal age peopl differ background miss\n",

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed., make documentari compel besid fact true storytel intrigu subject matter lot whether one worth watch nation geograph rescu taken back see full pictur member thai youth soccer team dramat rescu flood cavether lot thing like rescu one get see thing unfold real time cours week took studi situat devis plan best chanc success weather element liter describ true miracl team expert cave diver led effort give firsthand account everi major decis twist turn involv race clock adrenalin come retel eventsth thrill factor rival anyth hollywood churn even though suspens given everyon gener know stori end rescu documentari appeal age peopl differ background miss\n",

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed., make documentari compel besid fact true storytel intrigu subject matter lot whether one worth watch nation geograph rescu taken back see full pictur member thai youth soccer team dramat rescu flood cavether lot thing like rescu one get see thing unfold real time cours week took studi situat devis plan best chanc success weather element liter describ true miracl team expert cave diver led effort give firsthand account everi major decis twist turn involv race clock adrenalin come retel eventsth thrill factor rival anyth hollywood churn even though suspens given everyon gener know stori end rescu documentari appeal age peopl differ background miss\n",

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed., make documentari compel besid fact true storytel intrigu subject matter lot whether one worth watch nation geograph rescu taken back see full pictur member thai youth soccer team dramat rescu flood cavether lot thing like rescu one get see thing unfold real time cours week took studi situat devis plan best chanc success weather element liter describ true miracl team expert cave diver led effort give firsthand account everi major decis twist turn involv race clock adrenalin come retel eventsth thrill factor rival anyth hollywood churn even though suspens given everyon gener know stori end rescu documentari appeal age peopl differ background miss\n",

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is.

The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo.

The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed., make documentari compel besid fact true storytel intrigu subject matter lot whether one worth watch nation geograph rescu taken back see full pictur member thai youth soccer team dramat rescu flood cavether lot thing like rescu one get see thing unfold real time cours week took studi situat devis plan best chanc success weather element liter describ true miracl team expert cave diver led effort give firsthand account everi major decis twist turn involv race clock adrenalin come retel eventsth thrill factor rival anyth hollywood churn even though suspens given everyon gener know stori end rescu documentari appeal age peopl differ background miss\n",

The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town.

THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue.

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers.

            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful.

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",

If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished.

            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story.

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

            "I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating.

            "I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place., didnt follow stori happen everyth documentari news someth made harrow often terrifi watch realli wish id spoiler learn happen film unfold stori first time faint heart id suggest read first may hold well crush pressur fearwhat human be repres dread thing imagin happen remark soul fun moment rise present world better place film fantast job give men minut explain exactli great experi learn thema group selfprofess misfit oddbal happen skill set world elit soldier lack ragtag bunch men dont appear ordinari way display level courag couldnt even contempl im claustrophob least much time view paus take deep breathsth boy incred brave degre couldnt even take someth like twelv day trap insid cave diver surfac boy act like parent ten minut late pick mallth actual rescu preposter thing anyon could ever dream came plan dubiou success felt cours action boy saveda said didnt follow stori unfold saw documentari avail interest watch seem like afterschool movi concept idea event stori incred brought film life adroitli analyz rescuer also great job show u world isnt alway terribl place\n",
            "Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (\"Free Solo\") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named \"Amp\" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, \"What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?\"The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is \"two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself.\" The divers talk about how they had been \"outsiders\" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and \"nerds.\" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as \"insane\" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue., success follow oscarwin documentari easi task director e chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin free solo accomplish rescu tensionfil stori rescu young soccer player age coach trap tham luang nag non cave northern thailand though retreat boy often use past heavi prematur monsoon rain found surround water two mile cave entranc face long odd surviv captur drama filmmak reli hour footag film thai admir wife interview rescu team comput graphic use reenact becam danger film insid cavetrain cave diver recruit well thai navi seal u special forc australian medic expert thai nurs name amp bangngoen help translat thousand volunt undertak rescu cave claustrophob wind underground passageway challeng becam even real diver discov four pump worker trap far cave entranc undertak danger rescu becam trial run later attempt free boy cave rapidli fill water condit becam daunt one volunt former thai navi seal die lack oxygenwhen member seal conclud dive skill requir rescu attempt rick stanton john volanthen two highli experienc british diver call thailand inspir peopl mani background train come togeth world includ u china engag joint undertak captur world attent paraphras late poet georg eliot greater thing human soul feel join life strengthen one silent unspeak memoriesth documentari depict braveri determin diver offer look person goal compel stori one interview one diver say danger hobbi two part ego one part curios one part need prove diver talk outsid life alway regard misfit nerd fittingli stanton volanthen first discov lost boy coach ledg two mile cave taken refug heavi rain submerg rout followedfind boy begin ordeal howev get seem imposs task given monsoon threat rapidli fill cave though thousand gallon water drain cave dare propos bring boy reject insan australian doctor richard harri final approv way forward could seen result deepli move experi seen big screen experi full impact even clichridden close song dream wellmean oscarbait cannot ruin experi rescu\n",
            "Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10., dont give upa documentari event rescu mission soccer kid coach got stuck insid cave thailandi think heard littl bit event back almost memori come documentari wow emot power inspir time theater yearth documentari aspect extrem well done minim sidetrack stori got straight rescu spent entir time focus diver intens situat quit amaz also reinvent scene cave diver particip rescu ad real footag diver insid cave heartbreak watchi edg seat whole rescu mission glad didnt rememb anyth event idea rescu success mani time expect worst outcom made even worriedth diver interview incred retel stori told enough inform get audienc understand dire situat well emot throughout mission scene talk diver person life told enough got came feel draggedlastli theme give unif peopl beauti mani time diver thought imposs other encourag take risk give hope kid amount peopl came around globe particip help kid inspir gave hope humanityoveral incred documentari portray incred event\n",

            "The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called \"The Rescuers\".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving., world captiv youth soccer team got trap flood cave thailand documentari elizabeth chai vasarhelyi jimmi chin oscar free solo follow rescu mission collabor thai naval seal team diver u militari australia china reason given particularli short shrift freelanc diver around world squad british civilian led rick stanton john volanthen took center stage uniqu qualif situationsvasarhelyi chin somewhat hamstrung make doc sever reason includ fact netflix lock movi right soccer team famili couldnt interview old news footag use get side stori recreat also use footag avail filmmak made decis focu rescu personnel realli call rescuerseven constraint fact everybodi know turn rescu manag genuin suspens move\n",
            "I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021., believ scene reenact crew help rescu doesnt diminish great documentari contrari enhanc werent insist tenac courag british dive rescu would success computergener imag provid u idea big long danger cave also show intim life british diver reason passion dive director brought realism authent human documentaryon best documentari\n",

            "Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise., perfect documentari everi sens detail narr flow effortlessli well explain clearli well research side care realli taken make sure parti respect faith present technic standpoint also incred blend real footag reconstruct work especi cave underwat incred difficult place make film technic seemless fantast none terribl cgi poor act clich voiceov man get mani disast documentari rubbish tv importantli devast potenti situat incred courag braveri effort put forward mani hero realli shone nail bite also emot watch thing sure didnt give mention second thai navi seal die result blood infect caught result brave work rescu guess happen product documentari alreadi finish strang oversight otherwis\n",
            "\"The Rescue\" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen!

            "Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's \"Believe\" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized.

            "The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years., rescu probabl one best documentari tell suspens stori rescu effort save soccer team teenag boy underwat cave thailand back fault minim think drag tini bit small spot first half lack footag sometim lead instanc tell footag get reus didnt imag integr eventbut part set good second half documentari realli shine rescu plan carri plan expertli recount maximum dramat effect mani interviewe genuin interest engag peopl rightwa big fan direct duo last documentari free solo one might spectacular footag one tell power emot stori among best documentari past year\n",

For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends.

            "I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy \"falangs\" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for \"manslaughter\" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear., foreign live thailand event cave fairli close home personallyat time rescu happen awar thai author alway cooper scruffi falang derogatori term use thailand foreign show tri save boy cave along one adult documentari attempt somewhat make plain extent thai author actual hinder foreign thai navi seal fail guess situat might wors shown documentari produc felt tone truth bitthi documentari make clear exampl foreign diver variou time forbidden otherwis obstruct came thailand rescu individu trap cave entir risk injuri possibl death bare credibl thai evid said die rescu attempt foreign might prosecut thai law guess manslaught whatev might call truth incred peopl flown western world huge person risk quit certain would left die im afraid fact fairli typic way foreign gener treat thailandth guy made incred rescu instanc truli heroic glad documentari made clear\n",

        "Problem Solving: I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of the assignment, especially devising strategies to collect data from various sources and implementing cleaning and analysis techniques.\n",
        "Learning Experience: The assignment provided an excellent opportunity to learn and apply different NLP techniques in a real-world context, which is always enjoyable.\n",
        "Code Optimization: Optimizing code for efficiency and readability was satisfying, as it allowed me to improve my programming skills.\n",
        "Exploration: Exploring different libraries and tools for web scraping, text processing, and NLP was enriching and expanded my knowledge base.\n",
        "Time to Complete:\n",
        "The provided time to complete the assignment seems reasonable, considering the complexity and scope of the tasks involved. However, it ultimately depends on individual proficiency in Python programming, web scraping, and NLP concepts. Some learners may find it challenging to complete within the given timeframe, especially if they encounter unforeseen difficulties or have limited prior experience with the required technologies. Overall, I believe the allotted time strikes a balance between providing a sufficient challenge and ensuring completion within a reasonable timeframe."
